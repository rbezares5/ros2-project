The aim of this project is to create a ROS 2 system composed of several nodes to have a robotic arm play checkers using an integrated vision system, but the system could be expanded or modified to play other games of fulfill different specific tasks.

The main program creates client nodes that call their respective servers. It can be started with the following command: 

`ros2 run robotx application`

The first server is the calibrator node, which acquires the empty board and localizes the coordinates of the playable squares:

`ros2 run robotx calibration`

The main vision node must be initialized after the calibration has been performed, since no two processes can use the camera at the same time. It acquires the board with the pieces laid out and assings to each square a different number depending on the color of the piece in order to generate a logical representation of the board:

`ros2 run robotx vision `

The AI agent player node receives the state of the board and generates a move:

`ros2 run robotx agent`

The human player node also receives the state of the board and, after the human player makes a move, acquires a new board calling the vision server. Then it compares both boards to validate the move. It cannot generate a move until a valid play has been detected:

`ros2 run robotx human`

Lastly, the robot node takes the information of the move generated by the respective player node and sends it to the robotic manipulator via TCP/IP connection:

`ros2 run robotx robot`

The main functionality of the system is currently implemented as explained above.

The system has been implemented and tested on ROS2 Foxy running on Windows 10.
